\section{Introduction}

This documents presents and describes the procedure by which the data from the SE 2 \gls{hvac} system is gathered and stored. A brief description of \gls{hvac} systems is given and a database model that will be used for storing the raw data coming from the sensors in the \gls{hvac} network is presented and discussed in detail. The report is organized as follows: In Section \ref{section:background} a brief discussion on how \gls{hvac} systems operate and how they are comprised is presented along with a brief review of some of the current fault detection methods used in \gls{hvac}. Section \ref{section:dataAcquisition} describes the BACnet protocol on how it is used to access the raw data from the sensors. Finally Section \ref{section:databaseDesign} describes in detail how the database was designed and what are its advantages over other approaches for storing the data.
